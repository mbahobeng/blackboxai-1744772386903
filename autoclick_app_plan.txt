### Plan for Autoclick Application

#### 1. Project Setup
- Create a new Android project in Android Studio using Kotlin.
- Set the minimum SDK version to support the required features.

#### 2. User Interface
- Implement a floating action button (FAB) for adding new buttons.
- Create a layout for the main activity that includes:
  - A section to display the added buttons.
  - Controls for setting button size, delay between clicks, and time trigger.
  - A save settings button to store the configuration.

#### 3. Features Implementation
- **Add Button Feature**: 
  - Allow users to add buttons dynamically to the screen.
  - Each button should have configurable properties (size, position).

- **Button Size Adjustment**: 
  - Provide a UI element (e.g., SeekBar) to adjust the size of the buttons.

- **Delay Between Buttons**: 
  - Implement a setting to specify the delay between clicks for each button.

- **Time Trigger Feature**: 
  - Allow users to set a specific time for the autoclick sequence to start.

- **End Sequence Feature**: 
  - Provide an option to specify when the sequence of clicks should end.

- **Save Settings**: 
  - Implement functionality to save the button configurations and settings using SharedPreferences or a local database.

#### 4. Testing
- Test the application on a physical device (Mi10T Pro) to ensure all features work as expected.
- Validate the performance and responsiveness of the autoclick functionality.

#### 5. Documentation
- Create user documentation explaining how to use the application and its features.

#### Follow-up Steps
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications before proceeding with the implementation.
